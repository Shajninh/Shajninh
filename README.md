Here you can find an article I wrote in 2022 during my time in the MIT MITES Semester program. It explores the durable and medicinal properties of mussels, specifically how their byssal threads could be applied in surgical practices. I interviewed an MIT biomedical engineering alumnus and gained firsthand insight into his experimental processes.

I hope to publish more in the neartime future! To read more about my experiences with sustainable research, I have posts and my experiences listed on Linkedin.
